## Project Description

The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility and continuous operation, which presents unique opportunities for automated trading strategies. This project aims to develop an algorithmic trading system that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to optimize buy and sell decisions for cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, in real-time.

## Objectives

### General

Develop a modular algorithmic trading bot that:
1. Continuously captures market data from the Bitypre√ßo API (exchange).
2. Uses technical indicators to make buy and sell decisions.
3. Implements Reinforcement Learning strategies to optimize these decisions.

### Specific

- **Data Collection**: The bot continuously captures market data, such as prices, volumes, and other technical indicators, from the Bitypre√ßo API.
- **Technical Analysis**: Uses technical indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, among others, to identify buy and sell signals.
- **Order Execution**: Based on the generated signals, the bot executes buy and sell orders for cryptocurrencies.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implements RL agents that learn and optimize trading strategies based on historical and real-time data.
- **Backtesting**: Allows testing different trading strategies on historical data to evaluate their effectiveness before applying them in real-time.

### Adjustments and Improvements

The project is under continuous development, and the next updates will focus on the following tasks:

- [x] Data Collection
- [x] Technical Analysis
- [x] Order Execution
- [x] Backtesting
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning
- [ ] Integration with other exchanges
- [ ] Implementation of new trading strategies
